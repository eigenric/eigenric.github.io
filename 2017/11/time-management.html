</li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping all of your appointments in your head
is ineffective. That's why successful
people use calendar tools.  For example, I suggest
using Google Calendar. It is free and you can set
it up to send you email reminders for important
activities. Receiving a reminder email about a
trip a few days in advance is very useful.</p>
<p>Debería usar google calendar en el móvil.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a task management tool</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, keeping a to-do list is vital in
successfully managing your time. At first, you may
just use scraps of paper (I did that once as
well).</p>
<p>It is much more effective to use a dedicated
task management tool though. You could use a well
made paper notebook such as a Moleskine, or even a
digital tool (e.g. Remember the Milk, Microsoft
Outlook or Nozbe).</p>
<p>task es efectivo. Aunque quizás debería:
    - Autosincronizar
    - Almacenar tareas e ideas y luego filtrarlo</p>
<ol>
<li>Respect your need for sleep by getting 7 to 9
hours of sleep each day</li>
</ol>
<p>Cutting out sleep to have more fun or get more
work done is a short sighted strategy. While you
can pull off this strategy in your 20s to a
degree, it is a destructive habit to form.  Being
tired all day means that you will be able to make
effective use of your time, no matter how
organized you are. So make it a habit of getting
those legitimate seven to eight hours each night.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a weekly review of the past 7 days</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning how to do a weekly review is one of
the best time management habits for you to
develop. The Weekly Review is a concept created by
David Allen, author of the classic productivity
book Getting Things Done.</p>
<p>To get started with a weekly review, go through
the following steps:</p>
<p>â First, review your calendar for the
past week and the current week â look for
loose ends, meetings and other matters that need
further attention.</p>
<p>â Third, review your goals for the year
and make plans to work on them in the coming week.</p>
<p>This practice will help you to better plan your
schedule and avoid nasty surprises.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan to achieve four hours of real work per day</li>
</ol>
<p>Did you know that project managers often assume
people will be less than 100% productive per day?
Itâs true! You may have a standard
eightÂ hour work day but the reality is that only
half of that day is likely to be highly
productive.</p>
<p>The rest of the day will be taken up with
meetings, responding to email, browsing the
Internet and related activities.</p>
<p>Tip: Schedule your most important, high value
tasks in the morning, before you get tired.</p>
<p>Advertising Advertising</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on a single task at a time (i.e. no
multitasking!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Multitasking is a wasteful way to work.
Instead, you will achieve more if you choose one
activity at a time. For example, allocate one hour
in the morning to work on a proposal for a client,
then give yourself a short break.</p>
<p>7.Â Separate strategic and âbrain
deadâ tasks</p>
<p>High value strategic tasks are what companies
and clients pay for â coming up with new
product ideas, ways to reduce cost and other
improvements. However, it is difficult to deliver
creative insights all day long.</p>
<p>When the last hour of the day arrives and
youâre tired, work through âbrain
deadâ tasks like installing security
updates or tossing out old papers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Accomplish large projects by breaking them down
into smaller tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>The ability to accomplish large projects is one
of the most important time management hacks. For
example, if you are assigned with organizing a
corporate conference in six months, the effort may
feel impossible.</p>
<p>Get started by writing a plan and asking for
advice from people who have accomplished similar
projects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a maximum of three priority tasks per day</li>
</ol>
<p>At the beginning of the day, it is easy to come
up with a to-do list with dozens of items.
Unfortunately, unplanned phone calls, requests
from the boss and others quickly overturn the best
plans.</p>
<p>Instead, simply choose three important tasks
per day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn to delegate tasks effectively at work</li>
</ol>
<p>Effective managers (and successful
professionals) routinely delegate tasks so they
can focus on their work better. The basic steps of
effective delegation: describe the task and
deadline, explain it to the person who will
perform the task and ask to be kept informed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delegate household tasks as soon as you can
afford it</li>
</ol>
<p>During your 20s, you will have difficult years
as you start your career. Once you have additional
resources, look for domestic activities you can
delegate.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to use a dry cleaning
service to keep your professional clothes in good
condition.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the past to become better, not assign
blame</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeating past mistakes is one of the worst
ways to misuse your limited time. Thatâs
why it makes sense to have review your projects,
work deliverables and habits regularly.</p>
<p>For example, if your smart phone always runs
out of power during the work day, buy a charging
cable for the office. Putting that improvement in
action will save you time and frustration in the
future.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set deadlines for every task</li>
</ol>
<p>Giving deadlines to yourself is one of the best
ways to stay organized. A task without a deadline
is likely to frustrate you after all.</p>
<p>If your boss gives you a deadline for Friday,
you may want to get the work done on Thursday
instead so that you have time to review it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Schedule travel time on your calendar</li>
</ol>
<p>Travel time is a reality that we need to learn
to manage. For example, you may realize that it
takes you 10 minutes to travel from your main
office building to a nearby client building.</p>
<p>That means you cannot afford to schedule
back-to-back meetings and still be on time.</p>
<p>Tip: Plan for travel time using a worst case
scenario (e.g. heavy traffic) â that way,
you are more likely to arrive early.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put a proven productivity system like
âGetting Things Doneâ into action</li>
</ol>
<p>You donât have to come up with every
aspect of time management all on your own.
Instead, invest the time to read a great time
management book like Getting Things Done by David
Allen and put the ideas into action.</p>
<p>Tip: Set time aside every month to gain new
knowledge and become more effective by reading
good books: 11 Books To Make You Lead A Much More
Productive Life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put personal rest and relaxation on your
calendar</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are driven to achieve results, it is
easy to neglect yourself and work all the time.
Thatâs why it you should always have time
on your schedule for enjoyable activities.</p>
<p>For example, you may set aside Saturday
afternoons to read a good book at home or play
sports with friends.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take breaks during the work day</li>
</ol>
<p>Sitting in a chair at your desk all day is bad
for your health according to Popular Science. To
maintain your health and focus â key
inputs for good time management â take
breaks of 5-10 minutes every hour to walk around.</p>
<p>Simply getting a glass of water and stretching
for a few minutes will do wonders for your body.</p>

Your Desk.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn to say no effectively</li>
</ol>
<p>Saying yes to new responsibilities is a great
way to grow your career when you first get
started. Yet, this is a habit that you can take
too far. If you are a people pleaser and struggle
with saying no, then read The Power of No: Because
One Little Word Can Bring Health, Abundance, and
Happiness by James Altucher and Claudia Azula
Altucher.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use your values to make decisions about your
time</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding yourself is essential to managing
your time. For example, if your top value is
family then you will have to manage your work
requirements according to that value.</p>
<p>Discovering your values is challenging if you
have never given thought to this area before.</p>
<ol>
<li>Admit mistakes quickly and move on</li>
</ol>
<p>Covering up mistakes wastes everyoneâs
time including your own. You can achieve much more
in life if you admit your mistakes, solve the
problem and move on.</p>
<p>Most managers are willing to forgive mistakes,
especially if you are honest and work hard at
preventing the mistake from occuring again.</p>
