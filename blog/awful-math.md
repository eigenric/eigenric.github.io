I really think mathematics is a beautiful branch of the kwnowledge. It's
not just useful but plenful of harmony. Why am I writing this?

I think it's to prove my new math plugin. I have to create a new plugin
that uses `Katex` rendering because it's faster. But, at the moment, i'm
gonna use the mainstream `Mathjax`.

So, we can define the factorial thanks to the pi notation:

$$\prod_{i=1}^n i = n!$$

Isn't it the most beautiful equation you have seen in your entire life?

> Yes, it is.

Ejemplo de renderizado:

$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}$$

Y para probar un poquito...

$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}$$
