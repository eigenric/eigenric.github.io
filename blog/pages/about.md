Hi! I'm Ricardo, a Mathematician and Computer Scientist driven by curiosity.

I channel this curiosity into projects that bridge theory and practice. You can see it in my work on [machine learning](https://github.com/eigenric/aprendizaje-automatico){:target="_blank"}, my creative tools like [git-quotes](https://github.com/eigenric/git-quotes){:target="_blank"}, and my conceptual experiments like [turingfy](/blog/2025/07/como-suena-una-maquina-de-turing). I use the [Eigenric Blog](/blog) to share what I learn along the way.

Believing in the power of shared knowledge, I also cofounded the [DGIIM Underground](https://github.com/DGIIMUnderground){:target="_blank"} developer community.
