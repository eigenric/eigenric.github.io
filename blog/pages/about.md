Hey! I'm Ricardo, currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Mathematics & Computer Science in University of Granada, Spain. 

Due to my ongoing battle with [Crohn's disease](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/health_medicine/crohn's_disease/), I expect to finish next year (â‰ˆ 81% completed).

I have been involved in various personal projects, including:

- [machine-learning](https://github.com/eigenric/aprendizaje-automatico): Coursework based on [*Learning from Data Book.*](https://amlbook.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [git-quotes](https://github.com/eigenric/git-quotes): Add beautiful quotes to your commits *automagically*.
- [turingfy](https://github.com/eigenric/turingfy): Exploring Spotify Playlists as Post Turing Machines. Proof of Concept.
- [Eigenric Blog](/blog): A space where I share my thoughts on Mathematics and Computer Science.

I'm also proud to be a cofounder of [DGIIM Underground](https://github.com/DGIIMUnderground) dedicated to sharing collaborative class notes through GitHub.
