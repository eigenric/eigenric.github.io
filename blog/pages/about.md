Hi! I'm **Ricardo Ruiz Fdez. de Alba**. I'm an Open Source advocate and GNU/Linux user. My main programming languages are Python and C++ but I'm learning Haskell and Rust too.
Currently, I study a Dual Degree in Mathematics & Computer Science in Granada, Spain.

## Small Projects

- [**turingfy**](http://github.com/eigenric/turingfy): Spotify Playlists as Post Turing Machines. *WIP*
- [**git-quotes**](http://github.com/eigenric/git-quotes): Add beautiful quotes to your commits automagically.
- [**eigenric site**](http://github.com/eigenric/eigenric.github.io): Maths and Programming related thoughts.

I'm also proud of being cofounder of [DGIIM Underground](https://github.com/DGIIMUnderground/) which aimed to share collaborative class notes using Github for first-years students.
