Hi! I'm Ricardo Ruiz FernÃ¡ndez de Alba, a Dual Degree student in Mathematics & Computer Science at the University of Granada, Spain (â‰ˆ93.39% completed).

I'm currently working on my Final Degree Project (TFG), focusing on synthetic data generation from an IoT vehicle detection system using Transformer models. You can check out my progress on GitHub.

I'm also a co-founder of DGIIM Underground{:target="_blank"}, a collaborative platform for sharing class notes and academic resources.

Let me know if you'd like any refinements! ðŸš€
