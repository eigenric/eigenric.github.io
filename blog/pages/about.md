Hi! I'm Ricardo Ruiz Fernández de Alba, currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Mathematics & Computer Science in University of Granada, Spain.  Due to my ongoing battle with [Crohn's disease](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/health_medicine/crohn's_disease/){:target="_blank"}, I expect to finish next year (≈ 93.39% completed).

I have been involved in various projects, including:

- [machine-learning](https://github.com/eigenric/aprendizaje-automatico){:target="_blank"}: Coursework based on [*Learning from Data Book.*](https://amlbook.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [git-quotes](https://github.com/eigenric/git-quotes){:target="_blank"}: Add beautiful quotes to your commits *automagically*.
- [turingfy](https://github.com/eigenric/turingfy){:target="_blank"}: Exploring Spotify Playlists as Post Turing Machines. Proof of Concept.
- [Eigenric Blog](/blog): A blog where I share programming tips and some mathematical proofs.

I'm also proud to be a cofounder of [DGIIM Underground](https://github.com/DGIIMUnderground){:target="_blank"} dedicated to sharing collaborative class notes through GitHub.
