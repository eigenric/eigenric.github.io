:slug: me

Hi! I'm **Ricardo Ruiz Fernández de Alba**, a young Pythonista studying Computer
Science and Maths in Granada (Spain). During high school, I've been an
enthusiastic **self-taught programmer** in my free time. I love `Python`__ and I'm
constantly improving my skills in this language.

I'm also interested in Physics, Philosophy, Music harmony and others apparently
unrelated fields which share indeed *the art of discovering underlying patterns*.

    Pourtant, malgré tout

    *Ceci n'est pas moi*
